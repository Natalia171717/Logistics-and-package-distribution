## Logistics and package distribution

### About the project
- The project was developed exclusively using JAVA.
- The project involves a system that enables a logistics and distribution company to register and dispatch transfers, dynamically regulating the dispatch of the most profitable transfers as well as those pending delivery for an extended period, in order to prevent what is known as starvation. Additionally, the system collects statistics from the cities where the company operates.
- To properly understand and operate the system, please consult the [documentation](enunciado.pdf). The documentation is written in Spanish.
- The code and the tests can be found in the 'implementaci√≥n' folder, within the 'src' folder.
- To execute the project, it is necessary to have the JDK installed on your device. You can then execute each test file (or add your own tests) and verify the system.
